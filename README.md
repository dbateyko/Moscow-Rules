Drawing inspiration from "Oblique Strategies", and Finn Brunton's [presentation](https://livestream.com/internetsociety/tacticaltech/videos/165338513) at NYU MCC's Tactical Tech conference, this quick website is a generator for [the Moscow Rules](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Seminar_in_Tradecraft_and_HumInt/Moscow_Rules), a set of practical guidelines for spies.
